```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data<- read_csv("HW_#2.csv")

```

Make a plot for the demand curves

```{r}
demand_1<- ggplot(data, aes(x = Q_Low_Gallons_per_Day, y = Price_Dollars))+
  geom_smooth()
demand_1

demand_2<- ggplot(data, aes(x = Q_High_Gallons_per_Day, y = Price_Dollars))+
  geom_smooth()
demand_2
```

linear model of the the demand

```{r}
demand_low_lm<- lm(Price_Dollars~Q_Low_Gallons_per_Day, data = data)
plot(demand_lm)
summary(demand_low_lm)

demand_high_lm<- lm(Price_Dollars ~ Q_High_Gallons_per_Day, data = data)
plot(demand_high_lm)
summary(demand_high_lm)

# Equation for Low demand
alpha_low<- 2.199e+01
beta_low<- -1.355e-04
# p = alpha + beta(quantity)

#Equation for high
alpha_high<- 2.339e+01
beta_high<- -1.279e-04
# p = alpha + beta(quantity)
