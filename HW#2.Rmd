Make a plot for the demand curves

```{r}
demand_1<- ggplot(data, aes(x = Q_Low_Gallons_per_Day, y = Price_Dollars))+
  geom_smooth()
demand_1

demand_2<- ggplot(data, aes(x = Q_High_Gallons_per_Day, y = Price_Dollars))+
  geom_smooth()
demand_2
```

linear model of the the demand

```{r}
demand_low_lm<- lm(Price_Dollars~Q_Low_Gallons_per_Day, data = data)
plot(demand_low_lm)
summary(demand_low_lm)

demand_high_lm<- lm(Price_Dollars ~ Q_High_Gallons_per_Day, data = data)
plot(demand_high_lm)
summary(demand_high_lm)

# Equation for Low demand

#Equation for high

# p = alpha + beta(quantity)

Q_low2<- (alpha_low/-beta_low)
# Q_low = Q_low1*P + Q_low2
# equation for low demand group

Q_high1<- (1/beta_high)
Q_high2<- (alpha_high/-beta_high)
# Q_high = Q_high1*P + Q_high2
# equation for high demand group

Q_agg1<- Q_low1+Q_low2 # aggreagte low demand
Q_agg2<- Q_high1+Q_high2 # aggregate high demand

P_agg1<- 1/Q_agg1 # price for low demand

# Supply curve
